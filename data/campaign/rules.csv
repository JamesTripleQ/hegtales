""I am a Rear Admiral of the Hegemony Navy."" he begins, his tone measured but carrying a hint of pride. ""Currently, I serve in… let's call it an unspecified ministry. The less I say about it, the better —for both our sakes."" He chuckles softly, though his words leave no doubt about the secrecy surrounding his work.

His expression softens as he shifts to a more personal note. ""On the home front, I'm a very happily married man,"" he continues, his voice warming. ""My wife and I have three children. You might have heard their giggles during our meeting or perhaps not. Our castle is far more spacious than the cramped corridors of a spaceship, so they have plenty of room to run around without causing too much of a ruckus.""

They dart past, their carefree energy a stark juxtaposition to the heavy air surrounding the ceremony.

The procession moves deeper into the castle, its path deliberate and unhurried. Finally, it comes to a halt in a vast hall. The space is grand yet somber, its vaulted ceilings adorned with banners bearing the Ossum family crest and Hegemony flags, you even notice the flag of the Dominion.

The ceremony honoring Admiral Christian Ossum is a grand affair, attended by members of numerous noble houses. Among them is the increasingly influential House Rao. The great hall is filled with quiet murmurs of condolences and speeches extolling the Admiral's virtues, his dedication to the Hegemony and his loyalty.

Throughout the event, no one dares to mention how the information leading to his remains was obtained. It’s an unspoken agreement, a shared understanding that some truths are best left unspoken.

A banquet follows the ceremony, transforming the somber atmosphere into one of camaraderie and celebration. The clinking of glasses, the low hum of music, and the laughter of nobles fill the air. Stories are shared, toasts are made, and bonds between houses are reaffirmed. The event becomes as much about the living as it is about honoring the dead.",hegtales_Quest3_ReturnRet9:Continue,
